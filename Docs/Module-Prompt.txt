Please refactor the JavaScript code in "script.js" into modular components using ES6 modules. Separate the functionalities into distinct modules— for example:
  
  • An "audioContext.js" module for managing the AudioContext and related setup.
  • A "toneGenerator.js" module that includes functions for tone generation and noise creation (white noise and pink noise).
  • An "mp3Handler.js" module for handling MP3 uploads, playback, and stopping/clearing functionality.
  • A "visualizer.js" module for the different visualization methods (bar graph, kaleidoscope, etc.).

Ensure that:
  
  - Each module encapsulates its own responsibilities.
  - The modules use proper export/import syntax.
  - Error handling and state management remain robust.
  - The main file (e.g., "main.js") imports these modules to initialize and coordinate the application.

This modular approach should make the code more maintainable and provide a solid foundation for expanding functionalities.
